## Inspiration
Recently, I had some questions about a product’s services and was directed to the company’s chatbot. I had to type out my entire query, only to be met with a slow response that lacked clarity or relevance. The interaction felt mechanical and unengaging, offering little to no value. This frustrating experience highlighted the need for a more interactive, human-like, and impactful AI assistant that truly understands and assists users effectively.

## Problem Statement
Today  countless websites rely on AI chatbots to handle tasks like sharing basic information, troubleshooting, and customer care.
Not only do these simple chatbots are dull, boring  and lack the warmth of personal human interaction. Their responses are frequently slow, repetitive, and limited in scope, leaving users frustrated and disengaged. Instead of enhancing the user experience, they can end up feeling like a hindrance, failing to provide meaningful or helpful solutions.
