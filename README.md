## ðŸŒŸ Inspiration  
Recently, I had questions about a productâ€™s services and was directed to the companyâ€™s chatbot. I had to type out my entire query, only to receive a slow, unclear, and irrelevant response. 

The interaction felt mechanical and unengaging, offering little to no value. This frustrating experience underscored the need for a more interactive, human-like, and impactful AI assistant that truly understands and assists users effectively.

## ðŸš© Problem Statement  
Today, countless websites rely on AI chatbots for tasks like sharing basic information, troubleshooting, and customer care. However, these simple chatbots are often dull, boring, and lack the warmth of personal human interaction. 

Their responses are frequently slow, repetitive, and limited in scope, leaving users frustrated and disengaged. Instead of enhancing the user experience, they feel like a hindrance, failing to provide meaningful or helpful solutions.
